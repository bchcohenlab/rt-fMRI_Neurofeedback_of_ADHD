These are the files used by the stimulus laptop. All scripts can be run either through the PsychoPy GUI or by typing the command: ```python3 {script_name}```. The MSIT and neurofeedback scripts will pop up dialog boxes, where you should input the subject ID, run number, etc. The rest script will simply start and wait for the first scanner pulse. 

The 'parse_msit.py' script is not used during the participant visit itself. This is instead used afterward to view and analyze the participant's performance on the MSIT.
